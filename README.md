# My first project for Programming in C# class
This is a copied repository from my university class on C# (3rd semester).
The Project1.md document was written by my professor. The code in this project,
with the exception of an example class to test (AuthenticationService) was written by me.
This project is very simple and I've written nicer much things since then, but It was a place to start.

To ensure that the program works correctly, it's recomended to use Debug Parameters to supply input arguments - a correct path to a testclass assembly that has access to all of it's dependencies.
